            If you go to the website that this recipe is originally from you'll see that they're called
            "BA's Best Chocolate Chip Cookes". Well I just want to tell you that the title really doesn't lie.
            These cookies really are the best, seriously. They're slightly crisp around the edges and soft and chewy in the
            centre. You won't go wrong with this one. This recipe was sourced from <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies">Bon Appetit!</a>

            <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>6 oz. semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
                <li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Cut remaining 1/4 cup butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).</li>
                <li>Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain.</li>
                <li>Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Whisk in vanilla.</li>
                <li>Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).</li>
                <li>Portion out 16 balls of dough and divide them between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake the cookies until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cool on baking sheets & serve after cooled.</li>
            </ol>
