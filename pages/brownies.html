                <li>10 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup + 2 tablespoos unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>

            <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper</li>
                <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.</li>
                <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm.</li>
                <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
                <li>Add the flour and use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan. Enjoy your brownies.</li>
