        <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9-inch springform or regular cake pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.</li>
            <li>Beat in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped apples.</li>
            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even the top.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool on a rack in the pan and once cool remove the cake from the pan.</li>
            <li>Cake can be served warm or room temperature, plain or with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
