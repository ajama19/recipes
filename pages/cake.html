        <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter at room temperature</li>
            <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
        <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Grease a 9-inch springform or regular cake pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. 
        If using a regular cake pan, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease again.
        </p>
        <p>
        In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Using a handheld mixer with beaters or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. 
        Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. 
        Don't worry if the batter looks grainy at this point; that's okay. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped apples.
        </p>
        <p>
        Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even the top. Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
        Allow the cake to cool on a rack in the pan. Once cool, run a blunt knife around the edges of the cake. If using a springform pan, remove the sides. 
        If using a regular cake pan, carefully invert the cake onto the rack, remove the parchment paper, then gently flip the cake over and place right-side-up on a platter. Using a fine sieve, dust with confectioners' sugar (if using). 
        Cake can be served warm or room temperature, plain or with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
